Following is the tutorial on uploading container images to Dockerhub! In this guide, we'll walk you through the process of sharing your Docker images with others or deploying them to production environments using Dockerhub's cloud-based registry service.

Prerequisites
Before you begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

Docker installed on your local machine
A Dockerhub account (you can sign up for free at Dockerhub)
Step 1: Build Your Docker Image
First, you need to build your Docker image locally on your development machine. Start by creating a Dockerfile in your project directory with the necessary instructions to build your image. Here's a basic example of a Dockerfile for a Node.js application:

# Use the official Node.js image as a base
FROM node:14

# Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy package.json and package-lock.json to the working directory
COPY package*.json ./

# Install dependencies
RUN npm install

# Copy the rest of the application code to the working directory
COPY . .

# Expose port 3000
EXPOSE 3000

# Define the command to run the application
CMD ["npm", "start"]

Step 2: Tag Your Docker Image
Once you have built your Docker image, you need to tag it with your Dockerhub username and the desired repository name. Use the following command to tag your image:

docker tag <image-id> <your-dockerhub-username>/<repository-name>:<tag>
Alt text

Replace with the ID of your Docker image (you can find this by running docker images), with your Dockerhub username, with the name of your repository on Dockerhub, and with a version tag for your image (e.g., latest).

Step 3: Login to Dockerhub
Before you can push your Docker image to Dockerhub, you need to login to your Dockerhub account using the following command:

docker login
Alt text

Enter your Dockerhub username and password when prompted.

Step 4: Push Your Docker Image to Dockerhub
Finally, you can push your Docker image to Dockerhub using the following command:

docker push <your-dockerhub-username>/<repository-name>:<tag>
Alt text

Replace , , and with the corresponding values.

Conclusion
You have successfully uploaded your Docker image to Dockerhub. You can now share it with others or deploy it to production environments using Dockerhub's cloud-based registry service.
